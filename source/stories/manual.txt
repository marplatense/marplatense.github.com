All You Need to Know
--------------------

After you have Nikola installed:

Create a site:
    ``nikola init mysite``

Create a post:
    ``doit new_post``

Edit the post:
    The filename should be in the output of the previous command.

Build the site:
     ``doit``

Start the test server:
     ``doit serve``

See the site:
     http://127.0.0.1:8000

That should get you going. If you want to know more, this manual will always be here
for you.

DON'T READ THIS MANUAL. IF YOU NEED TO READ IT I FAILED, JUST USE THE THING.

On the other hand, if anything about Nikola is not as obvious as it should be, by all
means tell me about it :-)

What's Nikola and what can you do with it?
------------------------------------------

Nikola is a static website and blog generator. The very short explanation is
that it takes some texts you wrote, and uses them to create a folder full
of HTML files. If you upload that folder to a server, you will have a
rather full-featured website, done with little effort.

It's original goal is to create blogs, but it supports most kind of sites, and
can be used as a CMS, as long as what you present to the user is your own content
instead of something the user generates.

Nikola can do:

* A blog (`example <http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar>`__)
* Your company's site
* Your personal site
* A software project's site (`example <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`__)
* A book's site

Since Nikola-based sites don't run any code on the server, there is no way to process
user input in forms.

Nikola can't do:

* Twitter
* Facebook
* An Issue tracker
* Anything with forms, really (except for comments_!)

Keep in mind that "static" doesn't mean **boring**. You can have animations, slides
or whatever fancy CSS/HTML5 thingie you like. It only means all that HTML is
generated already before being uploaded. On the other hand, Nikola sites will
tend to be content-heavy. What Nikola is good at is at putting what you write
out there.

Why Static?
-----------

Most "modern" websites are *dynamic* in the sense that the contents of the site
live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a
user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues
that static site generators try to solve.

In a static site, the whole site, every page, *everything*, is created before
the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full
of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).

So, let's see some reasons for using static sites:

Security
    Dynamic sites are prone to experience security issues. The solution for that
    is constant vigilance, keeping the software behind the site updated, and
    plain old good luck. The stack of software used to provide a static site,
    like those Nikola generates, is much smaller (Just a webserver).

    A smaller software stack implies less security risk.

Obsolescense
    If you create a site using (for example) Wordpress, what happens when Wordpress
    releases a new version? You have to update your Wordpress. That is not optional,
    because of security and support issues. If I release a new version of Nikola, and
    you don't update, *nothing* happens. You can continue to use the version you
    have now forever, no problems.

    Also, in the longer term, the very foundations of dynamic sites shift. Can you
    still deploy a blog software based on Django 0.96? What happens when your
    host stops supporting the php version you rely on? And so on.

    You may say those are long term issues, or that they won't matter for years. Well,
    I believe things should work forever, or as close to it as we can make them.
    Nikola's static output and its input files will work as long as you can install
    a Python > 2.5 (soon 3.x) in a Linux, Windows, or Mac and can find a server
    that sends files over HTTP. That's probably 10 or 15 years at least.

    Also, static sites are easily handled by the Internet Archive.

Cost and Performance
    On dynamic sites, every time a reader wants a page, a whole lot of database
    queries are made. Then a whole pile of code chews that data, and HTML is
    produced, which is sent to the user. All that requires CPU and memory.

    On a static site, the highly optimized HTTP server reads the file from disk
    (or, if it's a popular file, from disk cache), and sends it to the user. You could
    probably serve a bazillion (technical term) pageviews from a phone using
    static sites.

Lockin
    On server-side blog platforms, sometimes you can't export your own data, or
    it's in strange formats you can't use in other services. I have switched
    blogging platforms from Advogato to PyCs to two homebrewed systems, to Nikola,
    and have never lost a file, a URL, or a comment. That's because I have *always*
    had my own data in a format of my choice.

    With Nikola, you own your files, and you can do anything with them.

Features
--------

Nikola has a very defined featureset: it has every feature I needed for my own sites.
Hopefully, it will be enough for others, and anyway, I am open to suggestions.

If you want to create a blog or a site, Nikola provides:

* Front page (and older posts pages)
* RSS Feeds
* Pages and feeds for each tag you used
* Custom search
* Full yearly archives
* Custom output paths for generated pages
* Easy page template customization
* Static pages (not part of the blog)
* Internationalization support (my own blog is English/Spanish)
* Google sitemap generation
* Custom deployment (if it's a command, you can use it)
* A (very) basic look and feel you can customize, and is even text-mode friendly
* The input format is light markup (`reStructuredText <quickstart.html>`_ or
  `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_)
* Easy-to-create image galleries

Also:

* A preview webserver
* "Live" re-rendering while you edit
* "Smart" builds: only what changed gets rebuilt (usually in 1 or 2 seconds)
* Very easy to extend with minimal Python knowledge.

Installing Nikola
-----------------

This is currently lacking on detail. Considering the niche Nikola is aimed at,
I suspect that's not a problem yet. So, when I say "get", the specific details
of how to "get" something for your specific operating system are left to you.

The short version is: ``pip install https://github.com/ralsina/nikola/zipball/master``

Longer version:

1. Get python, if you don't have it.
2. Get `doit <http://python-doit.sf.net>`_
3. Get `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net>`_
4. Get `Mako <http://makotemplates.org>`_
5. Get `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_
6. Get `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_

Any non-prehistorical version of the above should work, but the newer the better.

Then get Nikola itself (<http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/>), unzip it, and
run ``python setup.py install``.

After that, run ``nikola init sitename`` and that will create a folder called
``sitename`` containing a functional demo site.

Getting Started
---------------

To create posts and pages in Nikola, you write them in restructured text or Markdown, light
markups that are later converted to HTML (I may add support for textile or other
markups later). There is a great `quick tutorial to learn restructured text. <quickstart.html>`_

First, let's see how you "build" your site. Nikola comes with a minimal site to get you started.

The tool used to do builds is called `doit <http://python-doit.sf.net>`_, and it rebuilds the
files that are not up to date, so your site always reflects your latest content. To do our
first build, just run "doit"::

    $ doit
    Parsing metadata
    .  render_posts:stories/manual.html
    .  render_posts:posts/1.html
    .  render_posts:stories/1.html
    .  render_archive:output/2012/index.html
    .  render_archive:output/archive.html
    .  render_indexes:output/index.html
    .  render_pages:output/posts/welcome-to-nikola.html
    .  render_pages:output/stories/about-nikola.html
    .  render_pages:output/stories/handbook.html
    .  render_rss:output/rss.xml
    .  render_sources:output/stories/about-nikola.txt
    :
    :
    :

Nikola will print a line for every output file it generates. If we do it again, that
will be much much shorter::

    $ doit
    Parsing metadata
    .  sitemap

That is because `doit <http://python-doit.sf.net>`_ is smart enough not to generate
all the pages again, unless you changed something that the page requires. So, if you change
the text of a post, or its title, that post page, and all index pages where it is mentioned,
will be recreated. If you change the post page template, then all the post pages will be rebuilt.

Nikola is a series of doit *tasks*, and you can see them by doing ``doit list``::

    $ doit list
    Scanning posts  . . done!
    copy_assets        Create tasks to copy the assets of the whole theme chain.
    copy_files         Copy static files into the output folder.
    deploy             Deploy site.
    new_page           Create a new post (interactive).
    new_post           Create a new post (interactive).
    redirect           Generate redirections.
    render_archive     Render the post archives.
    render_galleries   Render image galleries.
    render_indexes     Render 10-post-per-page indexes.
    render_pages       Build final pages from metadata and HTML fragments.
    render_posts       Build HTML fragments from metadata and reSt.
    render_rss         Generate RSS feeds.
    render_site        Render the post archives.
    render_sources     Publish the rst sources because why not?
    render_tags        Render the tag pages.
    serve              Start test server. (Usage: doit serve [--address 127.0.0.1] [--port 8000])
    sitemap            Generate Google sitemap.

You can make Nikola redo everything by calling ``doit clean``, you can make it do just a specific
part of the site using task names, for example ``doit render_pages``, and even individual files like
``doit render_indexes:output/index.html``

The ``serve`` task is special, in that instead of generating a file it starts a web server so
you can see the site you are creating::

    $ doit serve
    Parsing metadata
    .  serve
    Serving HTTP on 127.0.0.1 port 8000 ...

After you do this, you can point your web browser to http://localhost:8000 and you should see
the sample site. This is useful as a "preview" of your work. You can combine add ``auto`` and do
``doit auto serve`` which makes doit automatically regenerate your pages as needed, and
it's a live preview!

By default, the ``serve`` task runs the web server on port 8000 on the IP address 127.0.0.1.
You can pass in an IP address and port number explicity using ``-a IP_ADDRESS``
(short version of ``--address``) or ``-p PORT_NUMBER`` (short version of ``--port``)
Example usage::

    $ doit serve --address 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
    Parsing metadata
    .  serve
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 ...

The ``deploy`` task is discussed in the Deployment_ section.

Creating a Blog Post
--------------------

A post consists of two files, a metadata file (``post-title.meta``) and a
file containing the contents written in  `restructured text <http://docutils.sf.net>`_
(``post-title.txt``), markdown or HTML. Which input type is used is guessed using
the ``post_compilers`` option in ``conf.py`` but by default, the extensions
supported are:

.txt .rst
    Restructured Text

.md .markdown .mdown
    Markdown

.htm .html
    HTML

The default configuration expects them to be placed in ``posts`` but that can be
changed (see below, the post_pages option)

You can just create them in ``posts`` or use a little helper task provided by Nikola::

    $ doit new_post
    Parsing metadata
    .  new_post
    Creating New Post
    -----------------

    Enter title: How to Make Money
    Your post's metadata is at:  posts/how-to-make-money.meta
    Your post's text is at:  posts/how-to-make-money.txt

The format for the ``.meta`` file is as follows::

    How to Make Money
    how-to-make-money
    2012/04/09 13:59

The first line is the title. The second one is the pagename. Since often titles will have
characters that look bad on URLs, it's generated as a "clean" version of the title.
The third line is the post's date, and is set to "now".

You can add two more optional lines. A fourth line that is a list of tags
separated with commas (spaces around the commas are ignored)::

    programming, python, fame, fortune

And a fifth line that's a URL for an original source of the post.

If you are writing a multilingual site, you can also create a per-language
metadata file. This one can have two lines:

1) The translated title for the post or page
2) A translated version of the pagename

You can edit these files with your favourite text editor, and once you are happy
with the contents, generate the pages as explained in `Getting Started`_

The post page is generated using the ``post.tmpl`` template, which you can use
to customize the output.

The place where the post will be placed by ``new_post`` is based on the ``post_pages``
configuration option::

    # post_pages contains (wildcard, destination, template, use_in_feed) tuples.
    #
    # The wildcard is used to generate a list of reSt source files (whatever/thing.txt)
    # That fragment must have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
    # and opcionally translated files (example for spanish, with code "es"):
    #     whatever/thing.txt.es and whatever/thing.meta.es
    #
    # From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
    # cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)
    #
    # These files are combinated with the template to produce rendered
    # pages, which will be placed at
    # output / TRANSLATIONS[lang] / destination / pagename.html
    #
    # where "pagename" is specified in the metadata file.
    #
    # if use_in_feed is True, then those posts will be added to the site's
    # rss feeds.
    #
    post_pages = (
        ("posts/*.txt", "posts", "post.tmpl", True),
        ("stories/*.txt", "stories", "story.tmpl", False),
    )

It will use the first location that has the last parameter set to True, or the last
one in the list if all of them have it set to False.

Alternatively, you can not have a meta file and embed the metadata in the post itself.

In restructured text::

    .. tags: test,demo
    .. slug: demo-test
    .. date: 2012/04/09 13:59
    .. link: http://foo.bar/baz

In Markdown:
    <!--
    .. tags: test,demo
    .. slug: demo-test
    .. date: 2012/04/09 13:59
    .. link: http://foo.bar/baz
    -->

Teasers
~~~~~~~

If for any reason you want to provide feeds that only display the beginning of
your post, you only need to add a "magical comment" in your post.

In restructuredtext::

   .. END_TEASER

In Markdown::

   <!-- END_TEASER -->

Additionally, if you want also the "index" pages to show only the teasers, you can
set the variable ``INDEX_TEASERS`` to ``True`` in ``conf.py``.

Drafts
~~~~~~

If you add a "draft" tag to a post, then it will not be shown in indexes and feeds.
It *will* be compiled, and if you deploy it it *will* be made available, so use
with care.


Creating a Page
---------------

Pages are the same as posts, except that:

* They are not added to the front page
* They don't appear on the RSS feed
* They use the ``story.tmpl`` template instead of ``post.tmpl`` by default

The default configuration expects the page's metadata and text files to be on the
``stories`` folder, but that can be changed (see post_pages option above).

You can create the page's files manually or use the helper ``new_page`` that works exactly like
the ``new_post`` described above, except it will place the files in the folder that
has ``use_in_feed`` set to False.

Redirections
------------

If you need a page to be available in more than one place, you can define redirections
in your ``conf.py``::

    # A list of redirection tuples, [("foo/from.html", "/bar/to.html")].
    #
    # A HTML file will be created in output/foo/from.html that redirects
    # to the "/bar/to.html" URL. notice that the "from" side MUST be a
    # relative URL.
    #
    # If you don't need any of these, just set to []

    REDIRECTIONS = [("index.html", "/weblog/index.html")]

It's better if you can do these using your web server's configuration, but if
you can't, this will work.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file is called ``conf.py`` and can be used to customize a lot of
what Nikola does. Its syntax is python, but if you don't know the language, it
still should not be terribly hard to grasp.

The default ``conf.py`` you get with Nikola should be fairly complete, and is quite
commented, but just in case, here is a full,
`customized example configuration <sampleconfig.html>`_ (the one I use for
`my site <http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar>`_)

Adding Files
------------

Any files you want to be in ``output/`` but are not generated by Nikola (for example,
``favicon.ico``, just put it in ``files/``. Everything there is copied into
``output`` by the ``copy_files`` task. Remember that you can't have files that collide
with files Nikola generates (it will give an error).

.. admonition:: Important

   Don't put any files manually in ``output/``. Ever. Really. Maybe someday Nikola
   will just wipe ``output/`` and then you will be sorry. So, please don't do that.

If you want to copy more than one folder of static files into ``output`` you can
change the FILES_FOLDERS option::

    # One or more folders containing files to be copied as-is into the output.
    # The format is a dictionary of "source" "relative destination".
    # Default is:
    # FILES_FOLDERS = {'files': '' }
    # Which means copy 'files' into 'output'


Customizing Your Site
---------------------

There are lots of things you can do to persoalize your website, but let's see the easy ones!

Basics
    You can assume this needs to be changed::

        # Data about this site
        BLOG_TITLE = "Demo Site"
        BLOG_URL = "http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar"
        BLOG_EMAIL = "joe@demo.site"
        BLOG_DESCRIPTION = "This is a demo site for Nikola."

CSS tweaking
    The default configuration includes a file, ``themes/default/assets/css/custom.css``
    which is empty. Put your CSS there, for minimal disruption of the provided CSS files.

    If you feel tempted to touch other files in assets, you probably will be better off
    with a `custom theme <theming.html>`_.

Template tweaking
    If you really want to change the pages radically, you will want to do a
    `custom theme <theming.html>`_.


Sidebar
    ``LICENSE`` is a HTML snippet for things like a CC badge, or whatever you prefer.

    The 'sidebar_links' option lets you define what links go in the right-hand
    sidebar, so you can link to important pages, or to other sites.

    The ``SEARCH_FORM`` option contains the HTML code for a search form based on
    duckduckgo.com which should always work, but feel free to change it to
    something else.

Footer
    ``CONTENT_FOOTER`` is displayed, small at the bottom of all pages, I use it for
    the copyright notice.

Analytics
    This is probably a misleading name, but the ``ANALYTICS`` option lets you define
    a HTML snippet that will be added at the bottom of body. The main usage is
    a Google analytics snippet or something similar, but you can really put anything
    there.

Getting More Themes
-------------------

There are not so many themes for Nikola. On occasion, I port something I like, and make
it available for download. Nikola has a builtin theme download/install mechanism, its
``install_theme`` task::

    $ doit install_theme -l
    Scanning posts  . . done!
    .  install_theme
    Themes:
    -------
    blogtxt
    readable

    $ doit install_theme -n blogtxt
    Scanning posts  . . done!
    .  install_theme
    Downloading: http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/themes/blogtxt.zip
    Extracting: blogtxt into themes

And there you are, you now have themes/blogtxt installed. It's very rudimentary, but it
should work in most cases.

If you create a nice theme, please share it! You can post about it on
`the nikola forum <http://groups.google.com/group/nikola-discuss>`_ and I will
make it available for download.

One other option is to tweak an existing theme using a different color scheme,
typography and CSS in general. Nikola provides a ``bootswatch_theme`` option
to create a custom theme by downloading free CSS files from http://bootswatch.com::

    $ doit bootswatch_theme -n custom_theme -s spruce -p site
    Scanning posts  . . done!
    .  bootswatch_theme
    Creating custom_theme theme from spruce and site
    Downloading:  http://bootswatch.com/spruce/bootstrap.min.css
    Downloading:  http://bootswatch.com/spruce/bootstrap.css
    Theme created. Change the THEME setting to "custom_theme" to use it.

Play with it, there's cool stuff there. This feature was suggested by
`clodo <http://elgalpondebanquito.com.ar>`_.

Deployment
----------

Nikola doesn't really have a concept of deployment. However, if you can specify your
deployment procedure as a series of commands, you can put them in the ``DEPLOY_COMMANDS``
option, and run them with ``doit deploy``.

One caveat is that if any command has a % in it, you should double them.

Here is an example, from my own site's deployment script::

    DEPLOY_COMMANDS = [
        'rsync -rav --delete output/* ralsina@lateral.netmanagers.com.ar:/srv/www/lateral',
        'rdiff-backup output ~/bartleblog-backup',
        "links -dump 'http://www.twingly.com/ping2?url=lateral.netmanagers.com.ar'",
        'rsync -rav ~/bartleblog-backup/* ralsina@netmanagers.com.ar:bartleblog-backup',
    ]

Other interesting ideas are using
`git as a deployment mechanism <http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto>`_ (or any other VCS
for that matter), using `lftp mirror <http://lftp.yar.ru/>`_ or unison, or dropbox, or
Ubuntu One. Any way you can think of to copy files from one place to another is good enough.

Comments
--------

While Nikola creates static sites, there is a minimum level of user interaction you
are probably expecting: comments.

The default templates contain support for `Disqus <http://disqus.com>`_. All you have
to do is register a forum, put its short name in the ``DISQUS_FORUM`` option.

Disqus is a good option because:

1) It doesn't require any server-side software on your site
2) They offer you a way to export your comments, so you can take
   them with you if you need to.
3) It's free.
4) It's damn nice.

.. admonition:: Important

   In some cases, when you run the test site, you won't see the comments.
   That can be fixed by adding the disqus_developer flag to the templates
   but it's probably more trouble than it's worth.


Image Galleries
---------------

To create an image gallery, all you have to do is add a folder inside ``galleries``,
and put images there. Nikola will take care of creating thumbnails, index page, etc.

If you click on images on a gallery, you should see a bigger image, thanks to
the excellent `colorbox <http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox>`_

The gallery pages are generated using the ``gallery.tmpl`` template, and you can
customize it there (you could switch to another lightbox instead of colorbox, change
its settings, change the layout, etc.).

The ``conf.py`` options affecting gallery pages are these::

    # Galleries are folders in galleries/
    # Final location of galleries will be output / GALLERY_PATH / gallery_name
    GALLERY_PATH = "galleries"
    THUMBNAIL_SIZE = 180
    MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = 1280
    USE_FILENAME_AS_TITLE = True

If you add a file in ``galleries/gallery_name/index.txt`` its contents will be
converted to HTML and inserted above the images in the gallery page.

If you add some image filenames in ``galleries/gallery_name/exclude.meta``, they 
will be excluded in the gallery page.

If ``USE_FILENAME_AS_TITLE`` is True the filename (parsed as a readable string)
is used as the photo caption. If the filename starts with a number, it will
be stripped. For example ``03_an_amazing_sunrise.jpg`` will be render as *An amazing sunrise*.

Here is a `demo gallery </galleries/demo>`_ of historic, public domain Nikola
Tesla pictures taken from `this site <http://kerryr.net/pioneers/gallery/tesla.htm>`_.

Optimizing Your Website
-----------------------

One of the main goals of Nikola is to make your site fast and light. So here are a few
tips we have found when setting up Nikola with Apache. If you have more, or
different ones, or about other webservers, please share!

#. Use a speed testing tool. I used Yahoo's YSlow but you can use any of them, and
   it's probably a good idea to use more than one.

#. Enable compression in Apache::

      AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css

#. If even after you did the previous step the CSS files are not sent compressed::

      AddType text/css .css

In the future we will be adding HTML/CSS/JS minimization and image recompression but
that's not there yet, so you may want to use 3rd party tools to achieve that.

Restructured Text Extensions
----------------------------

Nikola includes support for a few directives that are not part of docutils, but which
we think are handy for website development.

Youtube
~~~~~~~

To link to a youtube video, you need the id of the video. For example, if the
URL of the video is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_tupPBtWQ what you need is
**8N_tupPBtWQ**

Once you have that, all you need to do is::

    .. youtube:: 8N_tupPBtWQ

code-block
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a somewhat complicated directive to display code nicely. You can just
embed code like this::

    .. code-block:: python

        print "Hello World!"

Or you can include the code from a file:

    .. code-block:: python
       :include: /foo/bar/baz.py

listing
~~~~~~~

To use this, you have to put your source code files inside ``listings`` or whatever your
``LISTINGS_FOLDER`` variable is set to. Assuming you have a ``foo.py`` inside that folder::

    .. listing:: foo.py

Will include the source code from ``foo.py`` and also create a ``listings/foo.py.html`` page
and the listing will have a title linking to it.
